# 🌍 The Plastic Path: Choose to Reuse!

## 🎮 Overview

**The Plastic Path: Choose to Reuse!** is a choice-driven, interactive game built with **p5.js** and **p5.play** that tests players on their daily decisions regarding plastic usage. The game was developed for a **Game Jam** with the theme *\"What Hope Means to Me."*

To me, hope is keeping the world around us alive by making little but meaningful choices—like recycling, refusing single-use plastics, and repurposing products whenever possible. This game teaches us that *everyday decisions can add up to a greener, brighter tomorrow.* ????

### Example Situations:
