# The Plastic Path
### Overview
This game is a choice based game with Interactive storyline in the theme plastic recycling. As you make your choices through the story, it changes the story line according to the choices made: an wrong choice leads to a bad stryline, and a good choices will take you to a good storyline. The ultimate goal of this website is to reinforce plastic recycling in peoples mind and protect the environment. I made this game as a project to answer the prompt "What hope means to me" for girls who code summercamp.
